/*
Summary: This proogram creates an integer called score and a string called
result. Then the program compares score to 80. The result is passing if score
is equal to 80. The result is great if the score is greater than 80. The
reuslt is not passing for any other value of score. The program then prints
what the result was. In this case, the value of score is 80 so the program
will print "You Passed!"
